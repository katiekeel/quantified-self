`$ git clone git@github.com:katiekeel/quantified-self.git`

Node backend is [here](https://github.com/katiekeel/quantified-self), Rails backend is [here](https://github.com/case-eee/quantified-self-api). Clone either of them into a separate directory from the one above and run `$ npm start` for the express server of the Node backend app, `$ rails s`.

Run `$ npm start` again in this project's directory to start up your dev server.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to view the application in action!
